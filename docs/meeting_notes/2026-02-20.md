# Meeting Notes — 2026-02-20

## Decisions / Guidance
- Do the detailed routing for today.
- For planning-ahead dispatch, don’t worry about detailed routing; focus on amounts + locations.
- Create clusters: stops that are close AND have similar pickup frequency should be grouped and serviced together.
- Weather integration (API) may impact compost the most.
- There are ~75 locations now → clustering is encouraged.
- If two locations are close and have similar volumes, pick up both in one run.
- Transit times are short; travel-time variability should be small.
- Don’t have to include everyone daily (select subset).
- Forecast baseline: use what happened last week (even if nominally once per day).
- Use data to adapt and forecast (rolling updates).

## Action Items
1. Implement clustering logic (proximity + frequency).
2. Implement last-week baseline forecasting for stop-level demand.
3. Add weather features and compost adjustment.
4. Dispatch module: select stops today + K-day lookahead list.
5. Routing module: OR-Tools detailed routing for today’s selected stops.
